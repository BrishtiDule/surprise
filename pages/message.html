				<h1><span> Happy Anniversary !</span></h1>
				<p> Meri Jaan..sbse pehle to I wanna wish you a very Happy Anniversary! You have been such a caring, loving and sweet person in my life as I always say that "You are the best birthday gift that I've ever received". No matter how many times we fight or argue..(mostly its just me arguing :p) I always wanna be with you.. I always want our relationship to work out. Nobody can ever take your place in my life.. You have filled my heart with all your pure love <3. You are so amazing and just perfect that I don't know where would I be or what would I be doing if I never met you. You have changed me in a beautifully positive manner baby and I really appreciate whatever you have done for me since day one. You have made me such a confident girl that I never imagined of before. You understand me completely. You make me feel wholesome! 

I just wanna say thank you for accepting me the way I am and without any judgement loving me unconditionally. Thank you for all those magical and precious moments that we have shared and all the great time we have had. You have always made me feel so much happier than ever before. You are chashni to my gulabjamun...You are my everything and I love you from the core of my heart <3. You came as a bliss to me and today I wanna seal my love for you with a kiss :* :* ... mmmmmmmuuuuuuuuuaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh :* :* . I wanna feel your warmth forever. Just stay as the way you are and my feelings for you will never change <3. With each passing day my love for you increases and I can't live without you ! I miss you so much !

You are the only one I wanna see when I first open my eyes in the morning and before going to sleep. I know we are not together right now but your thought never leaves my mind even for a second baby. You are the reason for my happiness. You have such a great impact in my life (and I mean this in every sense :p) that my life is now full of hopes and fantasies :*.

Your smile is what makes me even more happier. I don't have enough words to explain the feeling that I felt when you came close to me in the rain under the umbrella on my birthday night. You have truly changed my life in ways you'll never understand. Everything in my life was so messed up until I met you. You are the spark of my life. You make my heart skip a beat from your hugs, your kisses, your love for me <3 ! 

This was the day we started our journey a year before. Being with you is none the less than a dream come true. I wanna have you in all phases of my life because I don't think that I'll ever get tired of your love baby! I have fallen so deeply for you and this means so much real to me than anything else I've had before with anyone else. You mean the world to me.

You have given me so much already.. What else could I ever ask for!

This was just a small effort to bring a smile on your face which I die for <3. I hope you would like it..I love you a lot meri jaan and I miss you sooo much.. I hope we meet soon and spend all the time again with each other like we did before. Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh :* :* :* !!!!!</p>
